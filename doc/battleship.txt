INTRODUCTION                                            *battleship-intro*

Battleship is a classic naval combat game playable directly within Vim. You
challenge the computer to a tactical battle, attempting to sink all of its
ships before it sinks all of yours.

The game features multiple difficulty levels and game variants to keep
gameplay fresh and engaging.

==============================================================================
GETTING STARTED                                         *battleship-start*

To start the game, use one of the following commands: >
    :Battleship
    :BattleshipNew
<
Both commands launch a new Battleship game in a new buffer.

When you first run the game, you'll be prompted to select:
  1. Your difficulty level (NOVICE or EXPERT)
  2. A game variant (ONE SHOT, HIT BONUS, or SHIP COUNT)
  3. Ship placement on your board
  4. Then battle against the computer

==============================================================================
GAME PHASES                                             *battleship-phases*

The game progresses through several phases:

LEVEL SELECTION ~
In this phase, use arrow keys (↑/↓) or j/k to navigate between difficulty
levels, then press Enter or s to confirm your selection. See |battleship-levels| for
details on each level.

VARIANT SELECTION ~
Choose your preferred game variant using arrow keys (↑/↓) or j/k, then press Enter
or s to confirm. See |battleship-variants| for descriptions of each variant.

PLACEMENT PHASE ~
Place all five of your ships on the board before the battle begins. Use arrow
keys or hjkl to position each ship, use Home, End, PageUp, PageDown (or 0, $,
H, L) for quick navigation to board edges, r to rotate it between horizontal
and vertical orientations, then Enter or s to place it. You'll be prompted for each ship
in sequence.

BATTLE PHASE ~
Once all ships are placed, the tactical battle begins. Use arrow keys or hjkl
to aim your cursor at enemy positions on the board, use Home, End, PageUp,
PageDown (or 0, $, H, L) for quick navigation to board edges, Enter or s to fire, and
ESC to end your turn. The computer will then take its turn based on the
selected variant.

GAMEOVER PHASE ~
When all ships of one side are sunk, the game ends. Press n to start a new
game or q to quit.

==============================================================================

==============================================================================
PLAYER LEVELS                                           *battleship-levels*

The difficulty levels determine how the computer AI plays:

NOVICE                 *battleship-level-novice*
The computer opponent shoots randomly at your board with no strategic
analysis. Ideal for beginners or casual play.

EXPERT                 *battleship-level-expert*
The computer uses probability targeting based on previous shots and hits.
It attempts to locate and sink your ships strategically. Recommended for
experienced players seeking a challenge.

==============================================================================
GAME VARIANTS                                           *battleship-variants*

The game supports three different rule variants:

ONE SHOT               *battleship-variant-oneshot*
You get exactly one shot per turn. The computer also gets one shot per turn
regardless of its previous result. This is the classic battleship variant.

HIT BONUS             *battleship-variant-hitbonus*
When you hit a target, you earn an additional bonus shot. Each hit grants
another bonus shot, allowing multiple consecutive shots as long as each is a
hit. On a miss, your turn ends. The computer follows the same rules.

SHIP COUNT            *battleship-variant-shipcount*
The number of shots you can take per turn equals the number of unsunk enemy
ships plus one. As you sink computer ships, you gain more shots per turn. This
creates accelerating gameplay as both sides progress through the battle.

==============================================================================
SHIPS                                                   *battleship-ships*

Your fleet consists of five ships:

  Ship Type          Size (cells)
  ─────────────────────────────
  Carrier                    5
  Battleship                 4
  Cruiser                    3
  Submarine                  3
  Destroyer                  2

During ship placement, you must position each of these ships on your 10x10
board. Ships cannot overlap or extend beyond the board boundaries. Use h, j,
k, l to move, r to rotate, and Enter or s to place each ship.

==============================================================================
